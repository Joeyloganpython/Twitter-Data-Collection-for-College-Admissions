    "### Project Scope and Impact\n",
    "\n",
    "The intention of this project is to develop a mechanism to analyze Twitter data related to the freshman admissions process at Philadelphia area colleges and universities. Sentiment analysis on data culled from Twitter allows institutions the opportunity to better understand their place in an increasingly digital landscape. Twitter reactions related admissions and financial aid for an institution can provide another metric to gauge population engagement, reputation, effectiveness of communications/marketing, and many other areas of an institution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Social media is regularly monitored by the communications departments at colleges and universities to. Specifically in admissions, staff will manually check various social media feeds for any reactions - positive or negative - around the time that admissions decisions are being released. Those preliminary sentiments can provide an informal indication in how an admissions cycle might progress. Additionally, this monitoring can identify any potential issues that were not discovered during testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "A sentiment analysis of admissions Twitter data would add value to the following:\n",

    "**Preliminary Data Collection**<br>\n",
    "Utilizing Twitter’s Advanced Search functionality, an initial collection of college acceptance tweets from Drexel and West Chester University were found. Each institution notifies its admitted students of a specific hashtag (#drexelaccepted, #wcuaccepted) which was searched during December 2017, one of two major decision release seasons for the incoming 2018 class. These search parameters confirmed that data with positive sentiment should be readily available as shown in the examples below. <br>\n",

What we need to look more closely at is the organization of the data elements to collect and store them as we did with the rest API above. Their nested dictionary structure has some similarities to the soccer tournament data. Most notably, the full_text value of the tweet is not contained in all results. These updates are the first priority to improve data collection going into the next segment of the course. Proper configuration will include a restarter script and some kind of schedule to dump the data for sentiment analysis and storage. Below is the commented out code and a sample result to demonstrate the availability of data."
